# HotelGroup6

Ok guys, 
this code is use to 
view room(s), 
book room(s), 
remove room(s)
inform the customer number of rooms that are in the hotel
and available room(s)
know attributes of a particular room
e.g roomNumber,
roomSize
bedSize
numberOfBed

so basically ArrayList in the Hotel class was used to acheive this goal.
which we call the Room class constructor in the Hotel class.
methods used, getters was most effiecient.
two classes and a class containing a main method.
